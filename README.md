## Hi there 👋

### I'm Waut, IoT Developer & Engineer from Antwerp, Belgium 🇧🇪 with a strong foundation in programming and embedded systems. I recently graduated with a degree in IoT (Internet of Things)

- 👨🏻‍🎓 Graduated Internet of Things at Karel de Grote Hogeschool
- 💻 **Programming Languages**: Python, C++, C#
- 💾 **Databases**: MySQL, SQLite
- 👮🏻‍♂️ **IoT Protocols**: MQTT, CoAP
- 👨🏻‍💻 **Embedded Systems**: Arduino, Raspberry Pi, ESP32
- 👾 **Development Tools**: Git, VS Code, PlatformIO
- 🍎 **Apple guy**

## Recent Projects

### ☔️ [Project 1: Rainwaterpit meter](https://github.com/waut10000/Simulate4)
Utilizing an ESP-32 paired with an ultrasonic meter, this project measures the empty space in a pit, calculates the water level, and communicates the data using MQTT. 
The data is then processed and stored using Node-RED and MariaDB on a Raspberry Pi Zero. 
The goal is to provide an easily accessible visual representation of the water level in the pit.

### 🔥 [Project 2: Firedetection system](https://github.com/waut10000/Project1-Build3)
In this project, I connected a waterproof temperature sensor and a OV2640 camera to my ESP32-S3.
The purpose of this project is that the system would be in the woods and if the temperatures rises above 25 °C, it would show a live feed of the view of the camera.

### 🗑 [Project 3: Smart trashbin](https://github.com/waut10000/Simulate-2)
This project was to make a smart trashbin. All over the city, there are public bins. Some are used frequently, some are not. 
So this means not all of the bins have to be emtied every week.

## Skills

- **Python**: Data analysis, automation, IoT scripting
- **C++**: Embedded systems programming, low-level hardware interaction
- **MySQL/SQLite**: Database design, management, and integration with IoT systems
- **Cloud Integration**: Connecting IoT devices to cloud services for data storage, processing, and analytics
- **Sensor Networks**: Designing and implementing networks of sensors for real-time data collection and analysis
- **Protocol Expertise**: Working with IoT-specific protocols such as MQTT and CoAP

## Contributions & Open Source

I’m a big fan of open-source and always looking to contribute to projects that align with my interests in IoT and embedded systems. Check out my repositories for some of the work I’ve done and feel free to fork, star, or create issues if you find anything interesting.

## Learning & Growth

I’m constantly learning and experimenting with new technologies, frameworks, and tools. Currently, I’m exploring:

- RaspberryPi 4B as a server with 2TB of storage and TimeMachine backup system
- RaspberryPi Zero W as adblocking with [Pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net/)

## Acknowledgements

A special thanks to the open-source community, educators, and my peers for their invaluable support and inspiration throughout my journey.
